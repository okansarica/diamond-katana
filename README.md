# Diamond Kata Project

The Diamond Kata project is an advanced software solution designed using C#, aimed at generating intricate diamond patterns from alphabet characters. This project encompasses a comprehensive suite of components including a console application, a RESTful API, and a React front-end for sophisticated pattern rendering. A hallmark of this project is its commitment to exhaustive testing and flawless integration, ensuring a product of superior quality and functionality.

## Development Overview

Development was methodically divided into two principal components, with dedicated efforts on separate branches named `feature/part-1` and `feature/part-2`. Following the completion of these phases, the branches were merged into the main branch, though they have been preserved for thorough review and analysis.

Technologies such as .NET 8 and React 18 were chosen for their robustness, with Swagger deployed to enhance API documentation, ensuring a seamless and efficient development process.

### Part-1

- **Focus**: Solely on the business layer and the console application, along with relevant test projects.
- **Functionality**: The business layer plays a pivotal role, handling core logic and generating lines for the diamond, with the console application displaying the output.

### Part-2

- **Expansion**: Includes the web API and adjustments to the business layer to meet API requirements and efficiently manage bandwidth, a consideration brought about by the integration of a React UI application.
- **Adaptation**: Maintains the integrity of the business layer's logic, with enhancements to drawing logic for both the console and React applications.

## Testing and Quality Assurance

A strong emphasis was placed on maintaining high levels of unit test coverage throughout the development process. Tools such as Xunit, Moq, and Fluent Assertion were employed for backend testing, while Jest and the React Testing Library facilitated UI unit testing. Scripts contained in the `package.config` file enable the generation of coverage reports and the execution of tests, underscoring the project's commitment to rigorous quality assurance.
